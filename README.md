# master-popup-generator
A custom little plugin that automates the creation of location popups. Works with Mapster.

#How to use:

1. Download Mapster 
2. Create a map
3. Create a category for the locations (e.g. shops)
4. Change the settings in a map to "add locations by category"
5. Upload your locations via geojson
6. Add them to the same category as the map
7. Add a jsonfile with the same locations as in the geojson file
8. Run the plugin

Note: This needs to be adjusted according to what you want in the popup.
